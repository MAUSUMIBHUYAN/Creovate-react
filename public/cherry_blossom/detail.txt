Declares an HTML document with UTF-8 encoding.
The <meta viewport> tag ensures the page is responsive on mobile devices.

//body
Removes margins for a full-screen effect.
Hides overflow to prevent scrollbars.
Sets a soft pink background (#fce4ec), resembling cherry blossom season.

//flower
.flower class styles each flower.
position: absolute; allows flowers to be placed freely.
background-image: url('flower.png'); sets the cherry blossom image.
background-size: contain; ensures the image fits within the div.
opacity: 0.8; makes flowers slightly transparent for a soft effect.
pointer-events: none; ensures the flowers donâ€™t interfere with user interactions.

//js
Creates a new <div> for the flower.
Assigns the .flower class.
Appends it to the body so it appears on the screen.

startPos: Random horizontal position (anywhere across the screen width).
duration: Random fall duration between 3 to 8 seconds (Math.random() * 5 + 3).
size: Random flower size between 40px to 80px (Math.random() * 40 + 40).

Sets the randomized horizontal position and size for each flower.

Animation Steps:

Starts slightly above the screen (-10vh).
Falls down past the screen (100vh).
Rotates randomly while falling (Math.random() * 360 and 720).
Fades out (opacity: 0).
duration * 1000: Converts the duration into milliseconds.

easing: "linear": Ensures a smooth, consistent falling motion.

.onfinish = () => flower.remove();: Removes flowers after they disappear to avoid memory overload.

Calls createFlower() every 200 milliseconds to generate a new flower.
